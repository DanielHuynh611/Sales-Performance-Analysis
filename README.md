# VoltEdge Electronics: 2020 Sales Performance Analysis
## Project Background
VoltEdge Electronics, a global electronics retailer, faced a challenging year in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Lockdowns, economic downturns, and shifts in consumer behavior significantly impacted sales performance. As a data analyst, my role is to evaluate the company’s sales trends, diagnose key problems, uncover growth opportunities, and provide strategic recommendations for 2020.
## Data Structure Overview
The analysis is based on data from five key tables:

1. **Sales**: Contains order details such as order number, product information, transaction dates, customer and store identifiers, and sales metrics.

2. **Customers**: Provides demographic and geographic details of customers, including gender, location, and birthdate.

3. **Products**: Lists product attributes such as name, brand, category, pricing, and cost details.

4. **Stores**: Contains store-specific information, including location, floor area, and store opening date.

5. **Exchange Rates**: Tracks currency exchange rates relative to the US dollar over time.

## Executive Summary
VoltEdge Electronics suffered a **50% decline in total revenue**, dropping from **$19.8M in 2019 to $9.2M in 2020**. Profitability and order volume declined at the same rate. The peak sales month in **December 2020 reached only $650K**, a quarter of its previous year's peak.

- **Sales Trends**: The drop in revenue started in the second half of 2020, coinciding with government restrictions and declining consumer income.

- **Product Category Analysis**: **Computers ($3.7M), Cell Phones ($1.3M), and Home Appliances ($1.2M)** were the **top-performing categories**, while **Games & Toys, Audio, and Music/Movies/Audiobooks** were the **lowest-selling**.

- **Retail Store Performance**: Large stores generated **higher total sales**, but were **less efficient**, as measured by **revenue per square meter (RPSM)**. The **bottom-performing 1/3 of stores, which account for 40% of total retail space, have significantly lower efficiency**.

- **E-Commerce Growth**: Online sales **grew steadily, reaching 22.3% of total revenue** in 2020, but remain underdeveloped. However, **delivery efficiency improved significantly**, reducing the **average delivery time from 7.3 days (2016) to 4 days (2020)**.

### 2. Sales by Category Analysis

**Best-Selling Categories (Figure 3):**

- **Computers**: $3.7M revenue (highest-performing segment)

- **Cell Phones**: $1.3M revenue

- **Home Appliances**: $1.2M revenue

**Lowest-Selling Categories (Figure 3):**

- **Games & Toys**: $154K revenue

- **Audio**: $453K revenue

- **Music, Movies & Audiobooks**: $566K revenue


**Market Insights:**

- Despite **increased digital entertainment consumption** (McKinsey, 2020)—with **49% of consumers watching more content, 36% gaming more, and 31% reading more** (Figure 4)— VoltEdge’s entertainment-related categories performed poorly. This highlights a **misalignment in marketing and product positioning** that needs to be addressed.

### 3. Retail Stores Performance

- **Metric Used**: **Revenue per Square Meter (RPSM)** as a measure of store efficiency.

- **Finding**: **Large stores generate higher total revenue but have lower efficiency**. Figure 5 highlights ten stores classified as "**Highest Total Area, Lowest Efficiency**". These stores account for **28% of the total store area**, resulting in disproportionately high operational costs. Additionally, these stores underperform in terms of **total revenue**. With the exception of Store 30 and 31, the other eight stores generate revenue that is either at or below the median revenue for all stores (Figure 6).

- **Implication**: Large stores with high operational costs and low efficiency need strategic intervention, such as closure, downsizing, or conversion to fulfillment hubs.

### 4. Online vs. In-store Sales Comparison
- **E-Commerce Growth**: Online sales grew from **16.8% (2016) to 22.3% (2020)** of total revenue (Figure 7), but it remains **underdeveloped** compared to competitors.

- **Delivery Efficiency**: Average delivery time improved **from 7.3 days (2016) to 4.0 days (2018)** and has **remained stagnant at 4.0 days through 2020** (Figure 8), reflecting strong logistical readiness but limited recent progress, showing strong logistical readiness for further e-commerce expansion.

- **Consumer Trends (Accenture, 2020)**:

  - The pandemic accelerated e-commerce adoption by **160%**.

  - Consumers increasingly utilized **in-app purchases, home delivery, chat-based support, and other digital services**.
  
  - These omnichannel habits will likely persist post-pandemic, making digital transformation crucial  (Figure 9).

## Recommendations

### 1. Diversify Product Categories

- **Mitigate Revenue Dependence**: The computer category accounts for a disproportionately high share of revenue. Diversifying product offerings will reduce over-reliance on a single category and mitigate associated risks.

- **Target Growth Opportunities**: Low-performing categories, such as **Games & Toys** and **Audio**, are expected to see increased demand due to the COVID-19 lockdown and the rise of home entertainment. **Increasing inventory** and **allocating additional marketing budgets** to these categories are recommended to capitalize on emerging trends.

### 2. Optimize Underperforming Stores

- **Store Closures or Repurposing**: The ten lowest-performing stores, identified by poor performance in both **revenue per square meter** and **total revenue**, should be considered for **closure** or **conversion into fulfillment hubs** to reduce costs and enhance efficiency.

- **Corrective Actions for Retention**: If downsizing is not feasible, corrective measures should be implemented, such as **restructuring layouts, enhancing promotions, and improving product arrangements** to drive sales.

### 3. Invest in E-Commerce Development

- **Accelerate Delivery Performance**: **Set ambitious goals** to further **reduce delivery times**, improving the customer experience.

- **Enhance Logistics**: **Optimize logistics** to better **support online sales operations and ensure scalability**.

- **Leverage AI for Growth**: Implement AI-driven tools such as **chatbots, recommendation engines, and targeted advertising** to enhance e-commerce marketing and customer engagement.

## Conclusion

VoltEdge Electronics’ performance in 2020 was significantly impacted by the COVID-19 crisis, leading to a 50% drop in revenue and declining sales across multiple categories. However, by focusing on e-commerce expansion, store optimization, and strategic product diversification, VoltEdge is well-positioned for recovery and long-term growth in 2021. Implementing these recommendations can potentially enable the company to adapt to changing consumer behaviors and build a more resilient operational model.
